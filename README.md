Formatting Outputs (Turbo C++)

Welcome to my FO Prototype! The code is done for code reference for our activity and works in Turbo C++ (TurboC7)

It's purpose is to be able to manipulate outputs of the program. I used it in order to be able to display up to 2 decimal points.
Though you can use double/float for that one too. 

If ya found any issues or something, feel free to tell me!!! If I was able to help atleast a bit I'll be glad ^ ^
